"""Behaviour tests for the run-stall watchdog.

The watchdog is the only thing that ends a run hung inside a tool or a
provider call, so its state transitions are covered here directly rather
than through a full ``run()``: a zombie run writes no ``state.json`` and no
``end`` trace record, which is exactly what these tests assert it now does.
