"""Regression: _SlidingWindowRateLimiter must not leak memory on unique keys.

The limiter keys on client IP.  A burst of unique IPs (a scan, a botnet, a
proxy farm) creates one deque per IP in ``_hits``.  The original code used
``defaultdict(deque)``, which creates an empty deque on every lookup — even
for a key that is immediately rejected — and never removes empty buckets.
Over time ``_hits`` grows without bound.

The fix: use a plain dict, and delete a bucket once all its entries expire.
