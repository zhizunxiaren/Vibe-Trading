# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The suite must never resolve its config root against the real ~/.vibe-trading
# (live mandate + audit-ledger state). Modules in BOTH categories must resolve
# to a temp sandbox:
#
#   * Import-time-baked constants (bound when the module is first imported,
#     i.e. during collection): loop.RUNS_DIR/SESSIONS_DIR, goal/session
#     _DB_PATH, helpers.ENV_PATH, memory MEMORY_BASE, skills USER_SKILLS_DIR,
#     strategy_store _DEFAULT_DB_PATH, swarm presets USER_PRESETS_DIR,
#     qveris QVERIS_CONFIG_PATH.
#   * Runtime Path.home() call sites: redaction's internal-root anchors
#     (_internal_roots_for_cwd), alpha_bench report output (_default_output_dir),
#     autopilot run dirs, uploads shadow_reports.
#
# Because the import-time constants are baked during test-module collection, the
# sandbox cannot be a pytest fixture (fixtures run AFTER collection); it has to
# be installed at conftest import time, before pytest imports any test module.
#
# The sandbox owns exactly ONE knob: the home directory. ``get_runtime_root()``
# consults ``VIBE_TRADING_HOME`` first and only falls back to
# ``Path.home()/".vibe-trading"`` (src/config/paths.py:27-34), so the override is
# DELETED rather than pointed at the sandbox. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
#
#   * A developer with ``VIBE_TRADING_HOME`` exported in their shell would
#     otherwise keep resolving to it — the leak this sandbox exists to close.
#   * Setting it would outrank every per-test ``monkeypatch.setenv("HOME")`` /
#     ``monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", ...)``, silently collapsing per-test
#     roots into one shared directory. That is not hypothetical: it made
#     test_shadow_account's "returns latest" read a profile another test in the
#     same file had saved.
#
# With the override gone, ``Path.home()`` is the single point of control, so a
# test redirecting home gets its own root on every platform and needs no
# knowledge of this sandbox. On Windows ``Path.home()`` ignores $HOME and reads
# %USERPROFILE%, so both spellings are set.

# rather than restating it. The assertions in _sandbox_runtime_root check that
# the redirect is INSTALLED, which is a proxy; this checks what #1116 is actually
# about — that nothing reached the user's own state — so a path the redirect does
# not cover fails the run with the artefact named, instead of quietly appending to
# a live audit ledger for another release. The ledgers are the headline harm
# (fabricated order_rejected records in an append-only, tamper-evident chain) and
# they move only on a real live action, so they cannot produce noise.
