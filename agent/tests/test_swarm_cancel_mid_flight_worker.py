"""Regression: cancel_run() must stop an already-dispatched worker promptly,
not just skip layers that have not started yet.

Pre-fix: cancel_event was threaded from cancel_run() into _execute_run and
_execute_layer, and polled between layers, but was never passed into
_run_worker_with_retries or run_worker. A worker already running when
cancel_run() fired ran to completion untouched, exactly the gap AgentLoop's
should_cancel mechanism (agent/src/agent/loop.py) already closed for the
main, non-swarm agent loop.

Post-fix: cancel_event reaches run_worker(), is passed to
ChatLLM.stream_chat() as should_cancel (interrupting an in-flight LLM
stream), and is checked at the top of each ReAct iteration and right after
the stream returns, mirroring AgentLoop's cooperative-cancellation
contract: an in-flight stream stops promptly and that turn's tool calls
are skipped, but a tool call already executing is not interrupted.
