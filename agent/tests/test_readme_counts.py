"""The five READMEs must agree with the code about how much of everything ships.

Every number these tests check is one a reader uses to decide whether the
project does what they need — how many MCP tools they get, how many skills,
how many backtest engines. They drift silently: a feature lands, the English
README is updated by hand, and the four translations keep yesterday's count
until somebody happens to look. Both counts these tests were written for had
already drifted this way (``analyze_options_payoff`` was missing from four
locale tool lists, and the ``investor-lenses`` skill from all five badges).

Locale independence is the whole difficulty. The numbers sit inside translated
prose, so nothing can be matched on wording. Instead each check anchors on
something that survives translation:

* the enumerated MCP tool list — the line carrying the most ``\\`name\\``
  literals, whose contents are code identifiers in every locale;
* the repository-tree line, anchored on ``mcp_server.py``;
* the MCP prose paragraph, anchored on ``stdio`` — dated news bullets are
  excluded, because an old entry mentions stdio too;
* the feature badges, anchored on ``<summary>…<sub>N …</sub></summary>``. The
  enclosing ``<summary>`` matters: a loose ``<sub>`` ("Plus 20+ specialist
  presets") sits among them, and it wraps onto its own line in English but not
  in the other four, so counting bare ``<sub>`` elements puts the locales out
  of step with one another.

A badge is asserted to *contain* its expected number rather than to start with
it, because the word order differs by language — "89 skills across 9
categories" against "9 个类别中的 89 个 skills". That still fails the moment the
code count moves, which is what this file is for.
