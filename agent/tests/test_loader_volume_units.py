"""Pin the volume-unit declarations of equity loaders (HKUDS/Vibe-Trading#1062).

Every A-share source declares board lots (1 lot = 100 shares) — baostock's
native single-share volume is normalized at its loader boundary; the
tencent/eastmoney loaders are market-dependent (A-share lots vs HK shares).
These pins lock the audit matrix from issue #1062 so a declaration cannot
drift silently — the cross-source 100x discrepancy that motivated the fix
was exactly such a silent drift.
