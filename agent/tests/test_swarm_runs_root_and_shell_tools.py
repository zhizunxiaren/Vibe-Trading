"""Regression tests for P03-A (run-root / store single source of truth) and
P03-B (MCP swarm wrapper must thread include_shell_tools; the filtered
registry must not silently drop a requested tool).

P03-A: the swarm store location and the run-dir sandbox allow-list were each
derived independently as ``<agent_root>/.swarm/runs``. A packaging layout
where the two anchors resolved differently put every worker run_dir outside
the allow-list with no error. They now share ``swarm_runs_root()``.

P03-B: ``mcp_server.run_swarm`` called ``start_run`` without
``include_shell_tools``, so stdio MCP swarm workers silently lost ``bash`` and
could not execute their own scripts.
