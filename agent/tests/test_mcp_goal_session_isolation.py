"""Regression: two concurrent MCP connections must not share a goal session.

Pre-fix: _resolve_session_id() fell back to a single process-wide id
(_mcp_session_id) whenever a caller omitted session_id, which is correct
for stdio (one process per client) but wrong for the http/sse transports
this file documents, where one process serves many concurrent
connections. Every such caller collapsed onto the same goal session, so
one client's start_research_goal() silently superseded another's.

Post-fix: _resolve_session_id() prefers FastMCP's own per-connection
ctx.session_id (real mcp-session-id header for StreamableHTTP, a cached
id for the other transports) before falling back to the process-wide id,
so concurrent connections that both omit session_id still get isolated
goal sessions.
