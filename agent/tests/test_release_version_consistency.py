"""Every version string the project publishes must be the packaged version.

`pyproject.toml` is the source of truth: `agent/cli/_version.py` derives
`__version__` from it, and the MCP server advertises that. Everything else is
a hand-maintained copy, and each copy that nothing compares is a copy that
rots silently.

Preparing 0.1.14 that is exactly what happened, twice. `agent/SKILL.md` — the
manifest published to ClawHub, which no build step touches because it is not
in the wheel — still advertised 0.1.13, and so did the Docker image's
`org.opencontainers.image.version` label. Both stayed green through the whole
suite. This file exists so the next release cannot repeat it: it enumerates
the declaration sites rather than spot-checking the ones somebody remembered.

The locale check globs the directory, so a newly added language is covered
without anyone remembering to extend this file.
