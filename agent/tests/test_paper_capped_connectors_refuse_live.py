"""Structural gate: paper-capped connectors refuse a live order before anything else.

``docs/paper-trading/PLAN.md`` promised a CRITICAL grep gate called
``test_paper_adapters_no_live_endpoints.py`` over ``src/paper_trading/adapters/``.
That layer never shipped — the connector architecture replaced it — so the gate
was never written against anything real, while two other documents went on
citing it as though it existed. This is that gate, against what did ship.

The invariant under test is the red line in CLAUDE.md: a broker exposing no
runtime paper/live discriminator is capped at paper and its order entry points
refuse a non-paper config *before* reaching the broker SDK. Checking the refusal
happens early is the whole point — a guard placed after the network call would
still pass a behavioural test that only asserts "it raised".

The connector list is derived from the filesystem, so adding a broker fails this
test until someone classifies it. That is the anti-drift property; do not
replace the enumeration with a hardcoded list.
