"""Empirical cross-source volume consistency guard (HKUDS/Vibe-Trading#1062).

Fetches the same settled A-share trading day from every reachable loader and
asserts the reported volumes agree within tolerance. This is the runtime lock
the #1062 audit called for: unit drift between fallback sources (the original
bug: baostock shares vs tencent/eastmoney lots, exactly 100x) fails loudly
here instead of silently corrupting volume analysis.

Network-guarded by design — sources unreachable from the test environment are
skipped individually, and the test skips entirely when fewer than two sources
are reachable, so CI without market access stays green.
