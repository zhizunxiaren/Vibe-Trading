"""A schedule shorter than delivery latency must not clobber the outbox row.

Dispatch returns once a run is *accepted*, not once it is delivered
(#942 / test_scheduled_delivery_outbox.py). is_due() only checked job.status
and next_run_at, so a job whose schedule interval is shorter than the time
its briefing actually takes to generate and send could re-fire while the
previous firing's outbox row was still PENDING or SENDING. _run_job then
unconditionally overwrote job.delivery with the new firing's DeliveryRecord,
and the previous session_id was gone from the record for good: sweep_
deliveries only ever reads the current job.delivery.session_id, so that
briefing was silently dropped with no error anywhere.
