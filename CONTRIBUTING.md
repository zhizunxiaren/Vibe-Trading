# Contributing to Vibe-Trading

Vibe-Trading is a natural-language finance research AI agent (FastAPI + ReAct
agent backend, Vite+React frontend, vectorized daily and options backtesting).
This guide covers contribution governance: the Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO) sign-off requirement, the reviewer checklist for Alpha Zoo factor
contributions, and the quickstart for adding a new alpha.

For general project setup (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`, dev servers,
`pytest --ignore=agent/tests/e2e_backtest`), see the README. For bug reports
and feature requests, use the GitHub issue templates.

For AI-assisted or automation-assisted contributions, also see
[`AGENT_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md`](AGENT_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md). It summarizes safe
local checks, higher-risk broker/MCP/credential surfaces, and the expected PR
risk notes for agent-authored changes.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Every commit in a community pull request MUST carry a `Signed-off-by:`
trailer. We do not require a CLA — the DCO is a lightweight per-commit
attestation that you wrote the code or have the right to submit it under
the project's MIT license. Maintainer-direct commits to `main` are not
subject to the trailer requirement (the maintainer's authorship is
already attested by the commit's author field), but community PRs are.

Sign your commits with `-s`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(factors): add gtja191 alpha 042"
```

This appends a trailer like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

PRs without a `Signed-off-by:` on every commit will be asked to rebase and
resign. To fix an unsigned series, run
`git rebase --signoff <base-branch>` and force-push the branch.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## Alpha PR Reviewer Checklist

This checklist applies to any PR adding or modifying files under
`agent/src/factors/zoo/**/*.py`. Reviewers MUST verify every box before
merging. Authors are strongly encouraged to self-check first.

- [ ] **Purity gate**: file passes `pytest agent/tests/factors/test_alpha_purity.py`.
  The AST scan rejects any imports outside the allowlist
  (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.*`, `src.factors.base`, `__future__`, `typing`,
  `math`, `dataclasses`) and any reference to forbidden names: `os`,
  `subprocess`, `socket`, `urllib`, `requests`, `httpx`, `pathlib`, `Path`,
  `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `__import__`, bare `open`, or `getattr` with a
  second argument beginning with `"__"`.
- [ ] **Lookahead gate**: file passes `pytest agent/tests/factors/test_lookahead.py`.
  No negative shifts, no forward leakage. `delta(df, d)` must have `d >= 1`.
- [ ] **`__alpha_meta__` present** with all required pydantic-validated fields:
  `id`, `theme`, `formula_latex`, `columns_required`, `universe`, `frequency`,
  `decay_horizon`, `min_warmup_bars`. Optional: `nickname`, `extras_required`,
  `requires_sector`, `notes`.
- [ ] **`compute(panel)` contract**: returns a DataFrame with the same shape
  as `panel["close"]`, NaN preserved at warmup / missing-data positions,
  no `+/-inf` values.
- [ ] **LaTeX matches code**: the `formula_latex` in `__alpha_meta__` and the
  formula in the module docstring describe what `compute()` actually does.
- [ ] **Per-zoo `LICENSE.md` updated** to cite the source paper / report and
  to state that formulas are mathematical facts, not subject to copyright,
  and that prose / tables / figures from papers and reports are not
  reproduced in this repo. Do NOT frame the bundled formulas using US
  affirmative-defense terminology — that is a litigation posture, not a
  license grant. State the mathematical-facts rationale instead.
- [ ] **Apache-2 attribution**: if the alpha is adapted from an Apache-2.0
  upstream (e.g. Microsoft Qlib), the file MUST carry a header of the form
  `# Adapted from <repo>@<commit-sha>:<path> (Apache-2.0). Copyright (c) <holder>.`
- [ ] **DCO**: every commit in the PR carries `Signed-off-by:`.

## Adding a New Alpha (Quickstart)

1. Pick the target zoo directory under `agent/src/factors/zoo/` (e.g.
   `gtja191/`, `alpha101/`, `qlib158/`, `academic/`).
2. Create `<alpha_id_short>.py` in that directory. Define `__alpha_meta__`
   (must satisfy the pydantic `AlphaMeta` schema in
   `agent/src/factors/registry.py`) and a pure `compute(panel)` function
   that imports only from `src.factors.base` plus the allowlisted stdlib /
   numpy / pandas / scipy.
3. Run the purity and lookahead gates locally:
   ```bash
   pytest agent/tests/factors/test_alpha_purity.py agent/tests/factors/test_lookahead.py -q
   ```
4. (Optional but recommended) Run a quick bench:
   ```bash
   vibe-trading alpha bench --zoo <zoo_id> --universe csi300 --period 2020-2025
   ```
5. Open a PR. Every commit must include `Signed-off-by:` (use
   `git commit -s`). Reviewers will walk the checklist above.

## Code Style

- Format with `black`; lint with `ruff` (config in `pyproject.toml`).
- Install both tools with the development extra: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- Run them on the Python files you changed, for example:
  ```bash
  black --check agent/src/example.py agent/tests/test_example.py
  ruff check agent/src/example.py agent/tests/test_example.py
  ```
  The repository does not yet enforce a whole-tree Black or Ruff check, so
  avoid mixing unrelated formatting cleanup into a focused pull request.
- Type-annotate all public function and method signatures.
- Google-style docstrings (`Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:`).
- Keep files under 400 lines where practical, 800 hard cap.
- No hardcoded paths, secrets, or URLs — config via `.env`, YAML, or
  module-level constants.
- Delete unused code rather than commenting it out.

## Attribution

Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers or AI-assistant attribution lines to
commit messages or PR descriptions. The DCO sign-off is the only required
trailer; keep commit metadata clean.

By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the
project's MIT license (see `LICENSE`).
